With all this knowledge on the internet, people should cut the crap out of it when creating videos. There is too much bloated information already.

That way, when creating videos, please aim to:

1. Topics in description

2. Less prolix approach (less talk and more action!)

3. Less self-promoting (although is hard)

4. Deeper topics if possible.

And now I am creating rules, right? Yep. Let’s forget that this post is an utterly nonsense bullshit rant for a moment and appreciate a world where information is good, non-biased, and straightforward.
