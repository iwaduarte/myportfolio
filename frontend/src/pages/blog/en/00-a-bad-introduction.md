![Jump or not to jump that is the question. (DALLE-2)](../../../assets/eagle.png) *Jump or not to jump that is the question (DALLE-2)*

This will be a **big fluffy post** for the rare times. To be honest I do not like it writing “that much”. However, in this special case, it is mandatory ( like losing my virginity was). It is full of mistakes, a lot of undesired attention, critics, and a lot of bad performance but in the end, we always remember it.

Let me warn you, no bullshits are needed. I am just starting myself and I will be your guide talking mostly about tech. You will be impressed (or not) by how stupid I sound and sometimes how deeply I will talk.

I hope we could really learn something together and open our horizons. I will maybe throw some jokes out of a context too in an attempt to make things special between us (we never know if I can get you to *worship* me later…)

In that journey, I will throw at you my unique perspective. For instance, being a lazy professional I will always go to the easiest simple route with less work involved. Nothing much fancy, nothing much complex. Just the simple yet sophisticated how to get things done.

Considering that I am not a native speaker, sometimes I will use my own jargon and maybe it will make you confused but as soon as we get to know each other you will get the gist of it.

In summary (**TL;DR**): Nowadays there are a lot of people generating crap/noise (o/). This is just another pretentious guy that thinks that he could do better and his introduction.

# Why are you writing anyway?

How many times did you get to a text or a video or even a podcast where someone spent **3000** lines speaking and speaking and speaking about something that everyone knows and does not have relevance, so in the end (or even worse in the middle) they brought something that is really really interesting but they go and explain it **poorly** or **wrongly** and makes everyone **confused**? *(imagine here a poker face, let’s work it out your imagination a little)*

Yeah. There are **A LOT** of people like that. There is A LOT of content like that. The Internet brought knowledge and connection but brought a lot of noise as well. Luckily for us, **I am not that guy**.

Or even a lot of people that get other’s people tutorials/ideas and make a crap version in order to bring attention to themselves?

***Nope*. *I am not* that guy either.**

I propose to do things differently. I do not know if I am going to *succeed*. But I might as well try. If I see something [marvelous](https://www.google.com/search?q=chapada+diamantina+po%C3%A7o+azul) you will have a backlink to the content and maybe a small commentary like *“That is *f\*\*\** awesome read it and get smart”* 

If I am talking about something that needs explanation. You will get that from me. Concise, direct to the point, and well-explained topics.

So what I will bring to the table:

- ***Direct to the point**:* ‘No bullshit attached. You are going to know exactly what I am going to talk about.  
- ***“Deep” (as far as my knowledge goes)**:* No “5 silly things that you probably only need to look to understand”. Here you will have thoughtful discussions of how [SSL(TLS now)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) really works from [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) times to RSA/DH. How to do a proper search (not using the LIKE operator) with only a database with FTS capabilities. How to configure API Gateway with S3 to trigger lambdas (using CloudFormation). How to profile and improve React component's performance while using nested maps.
- ***It is about myself and it is about others too***: Maybe I will make a friend, maybe I found love or hate. Maybe I will be ignored. Who cares…?
- ***Simple kid stupid communication***: *Layman’s terms* all the way even in the *technical* aspects. Like the old man, [*Feynman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) said (I have not read it much): “I’m smart enough to know that I’m dumb.”
- **Portuguese/English content**: This is also a medium for learning languages. Some of these tutorials will be also written/translated into Portuguese with slight changes. So viewers could get both languages practice. I believe it will be extremely beneficial for my fellow Brazilians.

Although I want to guarantee that I will bring insightful content I can not predict the future. After all, I am not mother [Diná](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A3e_Din%C3%A1h) :P

So let’s hope your stay here makes you wiser and if that is not the case at least you can have some fun at my ludicrous jokes. I promise that in that case, I will give you my best.
